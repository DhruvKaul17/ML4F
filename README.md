# ML4F
Cutting edge research in computational finance!

**Background**: 

ML4F is a research group contained within Manifold Computing. Our research lies at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Finance. Below we outline our vision, roadmap and contact information. We are moving fast and the first paper is underway. We are continually looking for curious, talented researchers to join or collaborate with our group. Please reach out using the attatched contact information if interested!

**Vision**: 

Our vision for ML4F is to build a research infrastructure that is immensely efficient at translating cutting ML research into practical trading systems and tooling. We aspire to bridge the gap between theoretical findings in AI research and practical trading methods that can be implemented with real capital. We inherit the open-source culture of Manifold Computting and in this way commit to making all findings, code and tools availible to those who wish to use them.
